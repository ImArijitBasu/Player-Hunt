## **DESCRIPTION** ‚Ü¥

**This website is made for a Cricket Player bidding Company , named  **`PLAYERHUNT`****   
*This contains all data's which are fetched as a json format but in local origin . As it is made with **`REACT`** a popular javascript library, it doesn't contains any loading! We haved used `VITE` for better project management , and as you know that vite includes hot reload , so it becomes much easier to manage a REACT app with VITE (spelled as v'e'e't). Ok now i have to go to to the main point of this project . This is a assignment project for Programming hero . With this assignment they have introduced us with the core concepts of REACT . As the assignment wasn't much easy , but somehow I managed to done this a day before deadline üòÅ. Now let me introduce you with this creative assignment ‚Ü¥*

*This Website is consist of 3 sections , first one is `Navbar` + `Banner` section , in this section nothing is much difficult to do , just there is a button called `Claim Free Credit` which gives the current user some money to buy their desired players. The money is added on the left side of the navbar . Then it comes the 2nd section , that is Called the `Main` section where all functionalities are happened. There we have fetch a data of some Cricket Player (& it's totally updateable , i can update players if i want üòé) . Here for example I have got 11 data of players from different countries. user can choose their desired players from this section by clicking the `Choose Player` button. When use clicks on to this button, players price is deducted from the total coin. And the players data is placed on another component. Also there are some conditions for perfect varification , if you want to see then visit my [website](https://ph-assignment-7-arijit.surge.sh/). Then it comes with the `Footer` section. it consists of two parts . NEWSLETTER and FOOTER . There are no special functionality in this part*
