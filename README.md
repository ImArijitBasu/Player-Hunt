## **DESCRIPTION** ‚Ü¥

**PLAYERHUNT** is a website designed for a Cricket Player bidding company.  
This website features all the data fetched in JSON format from a local origin. Built with **`REACT`**, a popular JavaScript library, it ensures fast and efficient performance with no loading delays! The project is developed using **`VITE`**, which provides better project management with features like hot reload, making it easier to manage a React app. 

This is a creative assignment project from Programming Hero, where the core concepts of React are explored. The assignment was challenging, but I managed to complete it just a day before the deadline üòÅ.

### **Website Structure:**
1. **Navbar + Banner Section**:  
   This section includes a button titled `Claim Free Credit`, which gives the current user some virtual currency to buy their desired players. The available balance is displayed on the left side of the navbar.

2. **Main Section**:  
   This is the core part of the project. Here, data of several cricket players is fetched (and can be updated as needed üòé). Users can choose players by clicking the `Choose Player` button, and the selected player's price is deducted from their total balance. The player data is then displayed in a separate component. There are some verification conditions in place to ensure smooth functioning. To see these in action, visit the live website.

3. **Footer Section**:  
   This part consists of two sections: **NEWSLETTER** and **FOOTER**. There is no special functionality here.
